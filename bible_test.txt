In the beginning God created the skies and the earth.
And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God <RF>Or, <i>was brooding upon</i><Rf>moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he_had_called Night. And evening occurred and morning occurred. One day [of creating had passed].<CM>
And God said, Let there be a <RF>Hebrew: <i>expanse</i>.<Rf>firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters: <RF>The Greek Septuagint preserves what seems to be the original location of these words, here, and elsewhere in this chapter, where it confirms the result of YHWH's spoken will.<Rf>[and_it_became so].
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.
And God called the firmament Skies. <RF>The Greek Septuagint preserves what seems to be the original location of these words, where it confirms YHWH's satisfaction with the result of his creating.<Rf>[And God saw that [it was] good.] And evening occurred and morning occurred. A second day [of creating had passed].<CM>
And God said, Let the waters under the skies be gathered together to one <RF>Whilst the Masoretic Text has 'place', a single different letter results in 'gathering' which is instead found in the Greek Septuagint and one of the Dead Sea Scroll of Genesis, 4Q8.<Rf>place, and let the dry land appear: and_it_became so. <RF>The Greek Septuagint preserves these words which are in keeping with the structure of Genesis 1.<Rf>[And the waters under the skies were gathered together to their_gathering, and the dry land appeared.]
And God called the dry land Earth; and (the) gathering_(together)_of the_waters he_had_called Seas. And God saw that [it was] good.
And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, green_plants yielding seed, <RF>Abundant ancient versional evidence indicates this 'and' here, though it is lacking from the majority of Masoretic Text manuscripts.<Rf>and_fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and_it_became so.
And the earth brought forth grass, green_plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind. And God saw that [it was] good.
And evening occurred and morning occurred. A third day [of creating had passed].<CM>
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the skies to divide the day from the night; and let them be for_signs, and_for_appointments, and_for_days and_years:
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the skies to give light upon the earth: and_it_became so.
And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: <FI>he made<Fi> the stars also.
And God set them in the firmament of the skies to give light upon the earth,
and to rule in_the_day and_in_the_night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that [it was] good.
And evening occurred and morning occurred. A fourth day [of creating had passed].<CM>
And God said, Let the waters swarm [with a] swarm of living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'. Deeper than the external body which you see, his soul also has a hidden 'heart' of things which you cannot see with your eyes, like his thinking and awareness of himself and his experience of life. Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>soul, and let birds fly above the earth <RF>Hebrew: <i>on the face of the expanse of the skies</i>.<Rf>in the open firmament of the skies: <RF>The Greek Septuagint preserves what seems to be the original location of these words, here, and elsewhere in this chapter, where it confirms the result of YHWH's spoken will.<Rf>[and_it_became so].
And God created the great reptiles, and every living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'. Deeper than the external body which you see, his soul also has a hidden 'heart' of things which you cannot see with your eyes, like his thinking and awareness of himself and his experience of life. Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>soul that moveth, with_which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. And God saw that [it was] good.
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
And evening occurred and morning occurred. A fifth day [of creating had passed].<CM>
And God said, Let the earth bring forth living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'.

And God made (the) lively_(beast)_of the_earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind. And God saw that [it was] good.
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the skies, and_over_the_cattle, and over every <RF>This word is preserved in the Syriac version.<Rf>lively_(beast)_of the_earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth: <RF>The Greek Septuagint preserves what seems to be the original location of these words, here, and elsewhere in this chapter, where it confirms the result of YHWH's spoken will.<Rf>[and_it_became so].
And God created the_man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them: and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the skies, <RF>This Hebrew word is translated into the Greek Septugint here.<Rf>[and_over_the_cattle,] and over every lively_(beast) -the_(one)_creeping upon the earth.
And God said, Behold, I have given you every green_plant yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:
and to every lively_(beast)_of the_earth, and to every bird of the skies, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein is living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'.

And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And evening occurred and morning occurred. The sixth day [of creating had passed].<RF>This account continues with Genesis 2:1-3 which has been wrongly divided from it. Genesis 2:1-3 relates what God ordained in the seventh day, completing the week. This is the conclusion of the story, and explains why the account is careful in telling us about what was created in each of the six days.<Rf><CM>
<RF>Genesis 2:1-3 is the conclusion of the account of creation found in Genesis 1, and has been wrongly divided from it, probably by those who disregarded God's Shabbat. It relates what God ordained in the seventh day, completing the week. This conclusion explains why the account is careful in telling us about what was created in each of the six days. Genesis 2:4 begins a second account of the creation which focuses more on the creation of the man and his woman.<Rf>And the skies and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.<CM>
<RF>Here begins a second account of the creation which focuses more on the creation of the man and his woman.<Rf>These are the generations of the skies and of the earth when they were created, in_(the)_day YAH__ God made earth and_skies.
And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no green_plant of the field had yet sprung up; for YAH__ God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not (a)_'adam to_work the_ground;
but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
And YAH__ God formed the_man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the_man became a living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'.

Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>soul.
And YAH__ God planted a garden eastward, in `Eden; and there he put the_man whom he had formed.
And out of the ground made YAH__ God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; (the) tree_(of) the_life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
And a river went out of `Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
The name of the first is Peeshon: that is it which compasseth all (the) land_(of) the_Heweelah, where there is gold;
and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the <RF>Or, <i>beryl</i><Rf>onyx stone.
And the name of the second river is Gaihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Kush.
