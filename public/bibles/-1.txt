<RF>Genesis 2:1-3 is the conclusion of the account of creation found in Genesis 1, and has been wrongly divided from it, probably by those who disregarded God's Shabbat. It relates what God ordained in the seventh day, completing the week. This conclusion explains why the account is careful in telling us about what was created in each of the six days. Genesis 2:4 begins a second account of the creation which focuses more on the creation of the man and his woman.<Rf>And the skies and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

And a river went out of `Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
The name of the first is Peeshon: that is it which compasseth all (the) land_(of) the_Heweelah, where there is gold;
and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the <RF>Or, <i>beryl</i><Rf>onyx stone.

And YAH__ God said, The_man's being for_his_onliness [is] not good; I_shall_effectuate for_him (a)_help like_his_complement.

That this declaration is from the Creator is known because Yeshu` says so in Matthew 19:5. That this becoming 'one flesh' is through sexual interaction -and that its occurrence is not enough to establish that the couple should remain together- is known because the 'one flesh' union occurs not only in proper marriage, but also in sexual immorality which is to be fled from (1 Corinthians 6:16-18). That becoming 'one flesh' was only intended for the uniting of husband and wife -without sexual sin- to result in a bond that is of Yah -a bond which man is not to separate- is known because the Lord Yeshu` plainly taught this (Mark 10:9, Matthew 19:6).<Rf>[(the)_two_of_them] shall_be one flesh.

And they heard the <RF>Or, <i>sound</i><Rf>voice of YAH__ God walking in the garden in the <RF>Hebrew: <i>wind.</i><Rf>cool of the day: and the man and his woman hid themselves from the presence of YAH__ God amongst the trees of the garden.<CM>

And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
And YAH__ God said to the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
And YAH__ God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou <RF>Or, <i>from among</i><Rf>above all cattle, and <RF>Or, <i>from among</i><Rf>above every lively_(beast)_of the_field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; <RF>This struggle formula "X's teshuqah [is] to Y, but Y shall_rule in X" is found in both Genesis 4:7 and in Genesis 3:16. Sin and curse is not the Biblical origin of YHWH's patriarchal order. YHWH's patriarchal order is already present when He creates Hewah after 'Adam (Genesis 2:20; 1 Timothy 2:12-13), from 'Adam (Genesis 2:21-22; 1 Corinthians 11:8), and for 'Adam (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 11:9), in the image of 'Adam (Genesis 2:18,23; 1 Corinthians 11:7), and the He brings her to 'Adam (Genesis 2:22) as He brought the animals to 'Adam (Genesis 2:19), and she receives her names not directly from YHWH but from her lord, 'Adam (Genesis 2:23; 3:20), even as did the animals (Genesis 2:19). So evidently she is created to fit in with his life -to be meet for him (Genesis 2:18)- and this because of YHWH's good order (Genesis 1:31), not because of sin or curse. This patriarchal order even pre-exists in the complex nature of the Father YHWH Almighty (Ephesians 3:15) who eternally rules over His eternal Wisdom (Proverbs 8:22-36), sending it forth from His mouth to do His bidding (Isaiah 55:11; John 1:1-3,14). This verse does not indicate that the woman was equal to the man before sin, just as it does not indicate that she was infertile before sin. The struggle formula may have been harnessed here to indicate that there would now be a struggle for the man from the woman and yet the man must retain mastery over her, even as in Genesis 4:7 Kayin would be troubled by sin but must retain mastery over it. Furthermore, scholars have conjectured that the struggle formula in Genesis 3:16 may have originally been more similar to the words in Genesis 4:7: that as Kayin would be confronted with sin, the woman would be confronted with labour pain: "and_to_thee [O woman] [shall be] its_lunge; (but)_thou, thou_shalt_rule in_(the midst of)_it." This is the conjectured original reading, and see 1 Timothy 2:14-15 where similar ideas are given. The masculine pronomial suffixes in this conjectured original text (for masculine nouns 'pain'/'conception') would appear to inadvertent copiests to have YHWH telling the woman, "thou_shalt_rule in_him" -rule over thy man! This in turn would have prompted scribes seeking to correct the text to reverse the formula producing "and_to_him [shall be] thy_lunge, (but)_he, he_shall_rule (over)_thee", and an addition of "thy_husband" to the formula would seem necessary to clarify their meaning. This could explain the origin of the archetype's text. Nevertheless, the archetype's text has been translated here, as it is not merely conjectural, but is consistently evidenced by the known manuscripts.<Rf>and_to thy_husband [shall be] thy_lunge, (but)_he, he_shall_rule (over)_thee.
And to 'Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy woman, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in <RF>Or, <i>sorrow</i><Rf>toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the green_plant of the field;
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return.
And the man called his woman's name <RF>That is, 'Living', or 'Life'. The first man's name -assuming that it was Proto-Semitic- was probably 'Adamu, and his wife's name was probably originally Haywatu, starting with the pharyngeal fricative pronunciation of letter heth. The H-W-Y root for 'life' persisted in Old South Arabian and Ethiopic, though it was generally replaced by a H-Y root in Hebrew. Conservative spelling explains the 'w' -rather than 'y'- in our mother's name. About 1000 BC, case endings dropped from nouns in many Semitic languages such as Hebrew, which would result in the names of our ancestors becoming 'Adam and Haywa. The diphthong 'ay' often became a long 'e' (sere) in Hebrew, which would explain the lack of a yod letter in this name 'Hewah'. Greek transcriptions from at least as early as 200 BC indeed evidence an 'e' quality vowel in this name, rather than the 'a' indicated by the later Masoretic text and Syriac.<Rf>Hewah; because she was the mother of all living.
And YAH__ God made for 'Adam and for his woman coats of skins, and clothed them.<CM>
And YAH__ God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also from_(the)_tree_(of) the_life, and eat, and live for ever -
therefore YAH__ God sent him forth from the garden of `Eden, to_work the_ground from whence he_was_taken.

In Numbers 18:12 and Numbers 18:27-32 the word 'fat' is used to refer to the 'best' part even of produce, and Deuteronomy 32:14 more fully expresses the idiom as 'kidneys' fat_of wheat'.<Rf>fats. And YAH__ had respect to Habel and to his offering:
but to Kayin and to his offering he had not respect. And Kayin was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
And YAH__ said to Kayin, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and_to_thee [shall be] its_lunge; (but)_thou, thou_shalt_rule in_(the midst of)_it.
And Kayin said to Habel his brother, <RF>The Masoretic Text lacks this sentence, but it is present in the Samaritan Hebrew, the Greek Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate, and the Syriac Peshitta, and is supported by multiple Aramaic Targums.<Rf>We_should_walk [in] the_field. And it_was, when they were in the field, that Kayin rose up against Habel his brother, and slew him.<CM>
And YAH__ said to Kayin, Where is Habel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?
And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground.
And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
when thou_workest the_ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.
And Kayin said to YAH__, <RF>Perhaps implying the punishment resulting from his iniquity<Rf>My_iniquity is big <RF>Perhaps the implication is 'beyond_forgiving'; or 'beyond_forgiving?' -even a question -approximately, 'Can I not simply be forgiven for this?' How sad that he evidences more concern for his future than for that he has sinned so greatly against his brother and against his Maker!<Rf>beyond_bearing.
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will be, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.
And YAH__ said to him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Kayin, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And YAH__ appointed a sign for Kayin, lest any finding him should smite him.<CM>
And Kayin went out from the presence of YAH__, and dwelt in the land of <RF>That is, <i>Wandering.</i><Rf>Nod, <RF>Or, <i>in front of</i><Rf>on the east of `Eden.
And Kayin experienced his woman; and she conceived, and bare Henokh: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Henokh.
And to Henokh was born `Irad: and `Irad begat Mahuya'el: and Mahuya'el begat Mathusha'el; and Mathusha'el begat Lamekh.
And Lamekh took to him two women: the name of the one was `Adah, and the name of the other Zellah.
And `Adah bare Yabel: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and <FI>have<Fi> cattle.
And his brother's name was Yubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
And Zellah, she also bare Tobel-Kayin, <RF>Or, <i>an instructor of every artificer</i><Rf>the forger of every cutting instrument of <RF>The common Hebrew word for 'copper' would likely be used generally for copper-based metals, including strong alloys such as bronze.<Rf>copper and iron: and the sister of Tobel-Kayin was No`emah.

And all the days of Yared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.<CM>
And Henokh lived sixty and five years, and begat Mathushalah:
and Henokh walked_about with the_God after he begat Mathushalah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

And Mathushalah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamekh:

And all the days of Mathushalah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.<CM>
And Lamekh lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
and he called his name Noh, saying, This same shall <RF>Hebrew: <i>nahem</i>, to comfort.<Rf>comfort us <RF>Hebrew:<i> from.</i><Rf>in our work and <RF>Hebrew:<i> from.</i><Rf>in the toil of our hands, <FI>which cometh<Fi> <RF>Hebrew:<i> from.</i><Rf>because of the ground which YAH__ hath cursed.
And Lamekh lived after he begat Noh five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
And all the days of Lamekh were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.<CM>
And Noh was five hundred years old: And Noh begat Shem, Kham, and Yapheth.<CM>
And it_was, when the_'adam began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
that (the) sons_of the_God saw (the) daughters_of the_'adam that they were good_[looking]; and they took them women of all that they chose.
And YAH__ said, My spirit shall not <RF>Or, <i>rule in</i>  According to Septuagint Version, Vulgate and Syriac <i>abide in.</i><Rf>strive with the_'adam for ever, <RF>Or, <i>in their going astray they are flesh</i><Rf>for that he also is flesh: <RF>Or, <i>therefore</i><Rf>yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.
The <RF>Or, <i>giants</i>  See Numbers 13:33.<Rf>Nepheeleem were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when (the) sons_of the_God are_coming to (the) daughters_of the_'adam, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, (the) men_of the_name.<CM>
And YAH__ saw that the wickedness of the_'adam was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
And it repented YAH__ that he had made the_'adam on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
And YAH__ said, I_will_blot_out the_'adam whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the skies; for I_am_grieved that I have made them.
But Noh found favor in the eyes of YAH__.<CM>
These are the generations of Noh. Noh was a righteous man, <FI>and<Fi> <RF>Or, <i>blameless</i><Rf>perfect in his generations: Noh walked with the_God.
And Noh begat three sons, Shem, Kham, and Yapheth.
And the earth was corrupt before the_God, and the earth was filled with violence.
And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.<CM>
And God said to Noh, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Make thee an ark of gopr wood; <RF>Hebrew: <i>nests.</i><Rf>rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it inside and outside with kopr.
And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
A <RF>Or, <i>roof</i><Rf>light shalt thou make for_the_ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it <RF>Or, <i>from above</i><Rf>upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under the_skies; everything that is in the earth shall die.
But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy woman, and thy sons' women with thee.
And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive.
And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
Thus did Noh; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.<CM>
And YAH__ said to Noh, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:
of the birds also of the skies, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I <RF>Hebrew: <i>blot out</i>.<Rf>destroy from off the face of the ground.
And Noh did according to all that YAH__ commanded him.<CM>
And Noh was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
And Noh went in, and his sons, and his woman, and his sons' women with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,
there went in -two, two- unto Noh into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noh.
And it_was after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noh's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of the skies were opened.
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.<CM>
In the selfsame day entered Noh, and Shem, and Kham, and Yapheth, the sons of Noh, and Noh's woman, and the three women of his sons with them, into the ark;
they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind; every bird, every wing.
And they went in to Noh into the ark -two, two- of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.
And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and YAH__ shut him in.
And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole skies were covered.
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every <RF>Or, <i>swarming thing that swarmeth</i><Rf>creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and_all the_'adam:
all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
And_he_blotted_out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the skies; and they were <RF>Hebrew: <i>blotted out</i>.<Rf>destroyed from the earth: and Noh only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.
And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.<CM>
And God remembered Noh, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of the skies were stopped, and the rain from the_skies was restrained;
and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of 'Urart.
And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.<CM>
And it_was at the end of forty days, that Noh opened the window of the ark which he had made:
and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in to_him, to the_ark.
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
and the dove came in to him toward evening time; and, lo, in her mouth <RF>Or, <i>a fresh olive-leaf</i><Rf>an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noh knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again to him any more.<CM>
And it_was in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noh removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried.
And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.
And God spoke to Noh, saying,
Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy woman, and thy sons, and thy sons' women with thee.
Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
And Noh went forth, and his sons, and his woman, and his sons' women with him:
every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.<CM>
And Noh built an altar to YAH__, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered ascending-offerings on the altar.
And YAH__ smelled the aroma_(of) assuagement; and YAH__ said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for_the_sake_of the_'adam, for (the) imagination_(of) (the) heart_(of) the_'adam [is] evil from_his_youth_(times); neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done.
While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.<CM>
And God blessed Noh and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth.
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the skies; with all with_which the ground <RF>Or, 'creepeth'<Rf>teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.
Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green plant have I given you all.
But flesh in its <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'. Deeper than the external body which you see, his soul also has a hidden 'heart' of things which you cannot see with your eyes, like his thinking and awareness of himself and his experience of life. Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>soul -its blood- shall ye not eat.
And surely your blood, <FI>the blood<Fi> of your <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'.

Whoso sheddeth (the) blood_of the_'adam, by_(means of)_the_'adam shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made_he the_'adam.
And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.<CM>
And God spoke to Noh, and to his sons with him, saying,
And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
and with every living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'.

And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'.

<RF>Or, <i>I have set</i><Rf>I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
And it shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,
and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'.

And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'.

And God said to Noh, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.<CM>
And the sons of Noh, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Kham, and Yapheth; and Kham is the father of Kana`an.
These three were the sons of Noh: and of these was the whole earth overspread.<CM>
And Noh began to be a land_worker, and planted a vineyard:
and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
And Kham, the father of Kana`an, saw the nakedness of his father, and_he_manifested [it] to his two brothers outside.
And Shem and Yapheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
And Noh awoke from his wine, and knew what his small son had done to him.
And he said,<CI><PI1>Cursed be Kana`an;<CI><PI1>A servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.<CM>
And he said,<CI><PI1>Blessed be YAH__, the God of Shem;<CI><PI1>And let Kana`an be <RF>Or, <i>their</i><Rf>his servant.<CM>
God enlarge Yapheth,<CI><PI1>And <RF>Or, <i>he shall</i><Rf>let him dwell in the tents of Shem;<CI><PI1>And let Kana`an be his servant.<CM>
And Noh lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
And all the days of Noh were nine hundred and fifty years. And he died.<CM>
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noh, <FI>namely<Fi>, of Shem, Kham, and Yapheth: and to them were sons born after the flood.<CM>
The sons of Yapheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Yowan, and Tobel, and Moshokh, and Teeras.
And the sons of Gomer: 'Ashkanaz, and Reephath, and Togarmah.
And the sons of Yowan: 'Eleeshah, and Tarsheesh, Ketteem, and Dodaneem.
Of these were the <RF>Or, <i>coastlands</i><Rf>isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.<CM>
And the sons of Kham: Kush, and Mezrayim, and Put, and Kana`an.
And the sons of Kush: Saba', and Heweelah, and Sabtah, and Reghmah, and Sabtakha'; and the sons of Reghmah: Shaba', and Dadan.
And Kush begat Nemrod: he began to be a_(powerful)_man in the earth.
He was (a) (powerful)_man_(of) hunting to_(the)_face_of YAH__: for_what_reason it is said, Like Nemrod (a) (powerful)_man_(of) hunting to_(the)_face_of YAH__.
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and 'Uruk, and 'Akkad, and Kalanneh, in the land of Shanghar.
Out of that land <RF>Or, <i>went forth 'Ashshur</i><Rf>he went forth into 'Ashshur, and built Neeneweh, and Rohoboth-`Eer, and Kalakh,
and Rasen between Neeneweh and Kalakh -the same is the (great)_big city.
And Mezrayim begat Ludeem, and `Anameem, and Lahabeem, and Naphtuheem,
and Pathruseem, and Kasluheem -whence went forth <RF>Hebrew: <i>Pelishtim.</i><Rf>the Pulishteem-, and Kaphtoreem.<CM>
And Kana`an begat Seedon his first-born, and Khet,
and the_Yebusee, and the_'Amorree, and the_Gergashee,
and the_Hewwee, and the_`Arkee, and the_Seenee,
and_the_'Arwadee, and the_Zamaree, and the_Hmathee: and afterward were the families of the Kana`anee spread abroad.
And the border of the Kana`anee was from Seedon, as thou goest toward Gerar, to Ghazzah; as thou goest toward Sodom and Ghomorrah and 'Adamah and Zeboyeem, to Lasha`.
These are the sons of Kham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.<CM>
And to Shem, the father of all the children of `Eber, <RF>Or, <i>the brother of Yapheth the older</i><Rf>the older brother of Yapheth, to him also were children born.
The sons of Shem: `Elam, and 'Ashshur, and 'Arpakhshad, and Lud, and 'Aram.
And the sons of 'Aram: `Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
And 'Arpakhshad begat Shalah; and Shalah begat `Eber.
And to `Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was <RF>That is, a 'Split'<Rf>Paleg; for in his days was the earth split; and his brother's name was Yektan.
And Yektan begat 'Elmodad, and Shaleph, and Hasramawt, and Yarakh,
and Hadoram, and 'Aizel, and Deklah,
and <RF>Most manuscripts of 1 Chronicles 1:22 indicate 'Ghaibel' and the Samaritan agrees even here.<Rf>`Obal, and 'Abeeme'el, and Shaba',
and 'Opheer, and Heweelah, and Yobab: all these were the sons of Yektan.
And their dwelling was from Meshsha', as thou goest toward Sephar, the <RF>Or, <i>hill-country</i><Rf>mountain of the east.
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.<CM>
These are (the) families_of (the) sons_of Noh, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.<CM>
And the whole earth was of one <RF>Hebrew: <i>lip.</i><Rf>language and of one <RF>Hebrew: 'words'<Rf>speech.
And it_was, as they journeyed <RF>Or, <i>in the east</i><Rf>east, that they found a plain in the land of Shanghar; and they dwelt there.
And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and <RF>That is, <i>bitumen</i><Rf>slime had they for mortar.
And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, and_its_head in_the_skies, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
And YAH__ came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of the 'Adam built.
And YAH__ said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to_effectuate: and now nothing will be withheld from them, which they purpose to_effectuate.
Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they not understand one another's speech.
So YAH__ scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because YAH__ did there <RF>Hebrew: <i>balal</i>, to confound.<Rf>confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did YAH__ scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.<CM>
These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat 'Arpakhshad two years after the flood.
and Shem lived after he begat 'Arpakhshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And 'Arpakhshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shalah.
and 'Arpakhshad lived after he begat Shalah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And Shalah lived thirty years, and begat `Eber:
and Shalah lived after he begat `Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And `Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Paleg:
and `Eber lived after he begat Paleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And Paleg lived thirty years, and begat Raghau:
and Paleg lived after he begat Raghau two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And Raghau lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
and Raghau lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nakhor:
and Serug lived after he begat Nakhor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And Nakhor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Tarah:
and Nakhor lived after he begat Tarah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.<CM>
And Tarah lived seventy years, and begat 'Abram, Nakhor, and Harran.<CM>
Now these are the generations of Tarah. Tarah begat 'Abram, Nakhor, and Harran. And Harran begat Lot.
And Harran died before his father Tarah in the land of his nativity, in_'Ur_(of) Kasdeem.
And 'Abram and Nakhor took them women: the name of 'Abram's woman was Sarai; and the name of Nakhor's woman, Melkah, the daughter of Harran, the father of Melkah, and the father of Yeskah.
And Sarai was barren; she had no child.
And Tarah took 'Abram his son, and Lot the son of Harran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son 'Abram's woman; and they went forth with them from_'Ur_(of) Kasdeem, to go into the land of Kana`an; and they came to Kharran, and dwelt there.
And the days of Tarah were two hundred and five years: and Tarah died in Kharran.<CM>
Now YAH__ said to 'Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land that I will show thee:
and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing:
and I will bless them that bless thee, and_(one)_lightly_esteeming_thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
So 'Abram went, as YAH__ had spoken to him. And Lot went with him. And 'Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Kharran.
And 'Abram took Sarai his woman, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Kharran: and they went forth to go into the land of Kana`an: and into the land of Kana`an they came.
And 'Abram passed through the land to the place of Shukhem, to the <RF>Or, <i>terebinth</i><Rf>oak of Moreh. And the Kana`anee was then in the land.
And YAH__ appeared to 'Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to YAH__, who appeared to him.
And he removed from thence to the mountain on the east of Baith-'El, and pitched his tent, having Baith-'El on the west, and the_Ghai on the east: and there he built an altar to YAH__, and called upon the name of YAH__.
And 'Abram journeyed, going on still toward the <RF>Hebrew: <i>Negeb</i>, the southern tract of Yhudah.<Rf>South.<CM>
And there was a famine in the land: and 'Abram went down into Mezrayim to sojourn there; for the famine (was) heavy in the land.
And it_was, when he was come near to enter into Mezrayim, that he said to Sarai his woman, Behold now, I know that thou art a woman beautiful_of appearance:
and it will be, when the <RF>That is, 'Egyptians'<Rf>Mezreem shall see thee, that they will say, This is his woman: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
And it_was, that, when 'Abram was come into Mezrayim, the Mezreem beheld the woman that she was very beautiful.
And the princes of Para`oh saw her, and praised her to Para`oh: and the woman was taken into Para`oh's house.
And he dealt well with 'Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-donkeys, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-donkeys, and camels.
And YAH__ plagued Para`oh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, 'Abram's woman.
And Para`oh called 'Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy woman?
why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my woman? Now therefore behold thy woman, take her, and go thy way.
And Para`oh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his woman, and all that he had.<CM>
And 'Abram went up out of Mezrayim, he, and his woman, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
And 'Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
And he went on his journeys from the South even to Baith-'El, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Baith-'El and the_Ghai,
to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there 'Abram called on the name of YAH__.
And Lot also, who went with 'Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
And there was a strife between the herdsmen of 'Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Kana`anee and the Perezzee dwelt then in the land.
And 'Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brothers.
Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if <FI>thou wilt take<Fi> the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if <FI>thou take<Fi> the right hand, then I will go to the left.
And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the <RF>Or, <i>Circle</i><Rf>Plain of the Yordan, that it was well watered every where, before YAH__ destroyed Sodom and Ghomorrah, like the garden of YAH__, like the land of Mezrayim, as thou goest to Zeghor.
So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Yordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
'Abram dwelt in the land of Kana`an, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against YAH__ exceedingly.<CM>
And YAH__ said to 'Abram, after when Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thy eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:
for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for to thee will I give it.
And 'Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the <RF>Or, <i>terebinths</i><Rf>oaks of Mamre', which are in Khebron, and built there an altar to YAH__.<CM>
And it_was in the days of 'Amraphel king of Shanghar, 'Aryokh king of 'Ellasar, Kodorlaghomor king of `Elam, and Tadghal king of <RF>Or, <i>nations</i><Rf>Goyeem,
that they made war with Bara` king of Sodom, and with Bersha` king of Ghomorrah, Shenna'ab king of 'Adamah, and Shum'obor king of Zeboyeem, and the king of Bala` -the same is Zeghor.
All these <RF>Or, <i>joined themselves together against</i><Rf>joined together in (the) valley_(of) the_Siddim -the same is the Salt Sea.
Twelve years they served Kodorlaghomor, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
And in the fourteenth year came Kodorlaghomor, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rapha'eem in `Ashtaroth-Karnayim, and the Zuzeem in Ham, and the 'Emeem in <RF>Or, <i>the plain of Karyathayim</i><Rf>Shaweh-Karyathayim,
and the_Khorree in their mount Se`eer, to 'El-Pa'ran, which is by the wilderness.
And they returned, and came to `En-Meshpat -the same is Kadesh- and smote all the <RF>Hebrew: <i>field.</i><Rf>country_of the_`Amalekee, and also the_'Amorree, that dwelt in Hazazon-Tamar.
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Ghomorrah, and the king of 'Adamah, and the king of Zeboyeem, and the king of Bala` -the same is Zeghor; and they set the battle in array against them in (the) valley_(of) the_Siddim;
against Kodorlaghomor king of `Elam, and Tadghal king of Goyeem, and 'Amraphel king of Shanghar, and 'Aryokh king of 'Ellasar; four kings against the five.
Now (the) valley_(of) the_Siddim was full of <RF>That is, <i>bitumen pits.</i><Rf>slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Ghomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.
And they took all the goods of Sodom and Ghomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
And they took Lot, 'Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.<CM>
And there came one that had escaped, and told 'Abram the `Ebree: now he dwelt by the <RF>Or,<i> terebinths</i><Rf>oaks of Mamre', the 'Amorree, brother of 'Eshkol, and brother of `Aner. And these were possessors_of (the) <RF>'Abraham had a covenant with these men; probably an alliance.<Rf>covenant_(of) 'Abraham.
And when 'Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them to Khobah, which is on the <RF>Or, <i>north</i><Rf>left hand of Damasc.
And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.<CM>
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Kodorlaghomor and the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaweh -the same is the King's Valley.
And Melkee-Zedek king of Shalem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of <RF>Hebrew: <i>'El `Elyon</i><Rf>God Most High.
And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be 'Abram of <RF>Hebrew: <i>'El `Elyon</i><Rf>God Most High, <RF>Having created all things, Yah has the right to all things, and possesses all things. Yet, in another way, He is actively acquiring all things, by bringing all things into submission to Himself and having victory over that which submits not.<Rf>Possessor-Acquirer_of Skies and_Earth:
and blessed be <RF>Hebrew: <i>'El `Elyon</i><Rf>God Most High, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
And the king of Sodom said to 'Abram, Give me the <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'. Deeper than the external body which you see, his soul also has a hidden 'heart' of things which you cannot see with your eyes, like his thinking and awareness of himself and his experience of life. Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>souls, and take the goods to thyself.
And 'Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to YAH__, <RF>Hebrew: <i>'El `Elyon</i><Rf>God Most High, <RF>Having created all things, Yah has the right to all things, and possesses all things. Yet, in another way, He is actively acquiring all things, by bringing all things into submission to Himself and having victory over that which submits not.<Rf>Possessor-Acquirer_of Skies and_Earth,
that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldst say, I have made 'Abram rich:
<RF>Or, <i>let</i> there be <i>nothing for me: only that...</i><Rf>except only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, `Aner, 'Eshkol, and Mamre'; let them take their portion.<CM>
After these things the word of YAH__ was to 'Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, 'Abram: I am thy shield, <RF>Or, <i>thy reward shall be exceeding great</i><Rf><FI>and<Fi> thy exceeding great reward.
And 'Abram said, <RF>The Masoretic Text has <i>'Adonai</i>, the original meaning of which was likely 'my_Lord'. It is spelled as 'my_lord' may be spelled.<Rf>My_Lord YAH__, what wilt thou give me, seeing I <RF>Or, <i>go hence</i><Rf>go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is <RF>Ususally interpreted <i>'Elee`ezer of Damasc'</i><Rf>Damasc 'Elee`ezer?
And 'Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast not given seed: and, lo, one born in my house is my heir.
And, behold, the word of YAH__ [was] to him, saying, This man shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.
And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward_the_skies, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall thy seed be.
And_he_was_trusting in_YAH__; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
And he said to him, I am YAH__ that brought thee from_'Ur_(of) Kasdeem, to give thee this land to inherit it.
And he said, <RF>The Masoretic Text has <i>'Adonai</i>, the original meaning of which was likely 'my_Lord'. It is spelled as 'my_lord' may be spelled.<Rf>My_Lord YAH__, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
And he said to him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half opposite the other: but the birds divided he not.
And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and 'Abram drove them away.<CM>
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon 'Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
And he said to 'Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the 'Amorree is not yet full.
And it_was, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
In that day YAH__ made a covenant with 'Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Mezrayim to the great river, the river <RF>This river is best known to English speakers through its Greek name, <i>Euphrates</i>. The Assyrian name is used here (without its variable case ending) which is consistant with the consonantal Hebrew text.<Rf>Puratt:
the Kenee, and the_Kenezzee, and the Kedmonee,
and the Khettee, and the Perezzee, and the Rapha'eem,
and the 'Amorree, and the Kana`anee, and the Gergashee, and the Yebusee.<CM>
Now Sarai, 'Abram's woman, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, <RF>That is, '(an)_Egyptian'.<Rf>(a)_Mezreet, whose name was Hagar.
And Sarai said to 'Abram, Behold now, YAH__ hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, to my handmaid; it may be that I shall <RF>Hebrew: <i>be built by her.</i><Rf>obtain children by her. And 'Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
And Sarai, 'Abram's woman, took Hagar the <RF>That is, 'Egyptian'.<Rf>Mezreet, her handmaid, after 'Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Kana`an, and gave her to 'Abram her husband to be his woman.
And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
And Sarai said to 'Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: YAH__ judge between me and thee.
But 'Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thy eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.<CM>
And YAH__'s messenger found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.
And YAH__'s messenger said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
And YAH__'s messenger said to her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
And YAH__'s messenger said to her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name <RF>That is, <i>God heareth.</i><Rf>Yishma`'el, because YAH__ hath heard thy affliction.
And he shall be [as] a wild donkey among men; his hand <FI>shall be<Fi> against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell <RF>Or, <i>to the east of</i><Rf>opposite all his brothers.
And she called the name of YAH__ that spoke to her, <RF>Or, <i>Thou God seest me</i><Rf>Thou art <RF>Hebrew: <i>El roi</i>, that is, <i>God of seeing.</i><Rf>a God that seeth: for she said, Have I also here seen after (the one) seeing me?
For_what_reason the well was called <RF>That is, '(The) well_(of) the_living_(one) seeing_me.'<Rf>Be'er-Lahhay-Ro'ee. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Barad.<CM>
And Hagar bare 'Abram a son: and 'Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Yishma`'el.
And 'Abram was eighty and six years old, when Hagar bare Yishma`'el to 'Abram.<CM>
And when 'Abram was ninety years old and nine, YAH__ appeared to 'Abram, and said to him, I am <RF>Hebrew: <i>'El Shaddai</i><Rf>God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
And 'Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
Neither shall thy name any more be called <RF>That is, <i>exalted Father</i><Rf>'Abram, but thy name shall be <RF>That is, <i>father of a multitude</i><Rf>'Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee, throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.
And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Kana`an, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.<CM>
And God said to 'Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.
This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.
And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.
He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.<CM>
And God said to 'Abraham, As for Sarai thy woman, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but <RF>That is, <i>Princess.</i><Rf>Sarrah shall her name be.
And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be <FI>a mother of<Fi> nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.
Then 'Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarrah, that is ninety years old, bear?
And 'Abraham said to the_God, Oh that Yishma`'el might live before thee!
And God said, Nevertheless Sarrah thy woman shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name <RF>From the Hebrew word meaning <i>to laugh.</i><Rf>Yizahak: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.
And as for Yishma`'el, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
But my covenant will I establish with Yizahak, whom Sarrah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.<CM>
And_he_finished_(off) talking with_him, and God went up from 'Abraham.
And 'Abraham took Yishma`'el his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of 'Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said to him.
And 'Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
And Yishma`'el his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
In the selfsame day was 'Abraham circumcised, and Yishma`'el his son.
And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.<CM>
And YAH__ appeared to him by the <RF>Or, <i>terebinths</i><Rf>oaks of Mamre', as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood opposite him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
and said, <RF>The Masoretic Text has <i>'Adonai</i>, the original meaning of which was likely 'my_Lord'. It is spelled as 'my_lord' and 'my_lords' may be spelled.<Rf>My_Lord, if now I have found favor <RF>The Samaritan text has 'in_your_eyes, pass not away, (I pray you), from your_servant'.<Rf>in_thy_eyes, pass not away, (I pray thee), from thy_servant:
let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: <RF>Or, 'for therefore'<Rf>forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
And 'Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarrah, and said, Make ready quickly three sa'eem of fine flour, knead it, and make cakes.
And 'Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it to the servant; and he hasted to dress it.
And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.<CM>
And they said to him, Where is Sarrah thy woman? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
And he said, I will certainly return to thee when the season <RF>Hebrew: 'liveth' or 'reviveth'<Rf>cometh_round; and, lo, Sarrah thy woman shall have a son. And Sarrah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
Now 'Abraham and Sarrah were old, advancing in the days [of their lives]; it had ceased to be with Sarrah after the manner of women.
And Sarrah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old, shall (a)_delightful_thing be for_me? And_my_lord [is] old.
And YAH__ said to 'Abraham, For_what_reason did Sarrah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety give_birth, who am old?
Is anything too <RF>Or, <i>wonderful</i><Rf>hard for YAH__? At the set time I will return to thee, when the season <RF>Hebrew<i>: liveth</i>, or, <i>reviveth.</i><Rf>cometh round, and Sarrah shall have a son.
Then Sarrah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<CM>
And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and 'Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
And YAH__ said, Shall I hide from 'Abraham that which I do;
seeing that 'Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of YAH__, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that YAH__ may bring upon 'Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
And YAH__ said, Because the cry of Sodom and Ghomorrah is great, and <RF>Or, <i>Verily</i><Rf>because their sin is very grievous;
I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.<CM>
And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but 'Abraham stood yet before YAH__.
And 'Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?
Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
And YAH__ said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.
And 'Abraham responded and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to <RF>Many Hebrew manuscripts preserve the Name here, though the Masoretic Text largely replaces it with <i>'Adonai</i>.<Rf>YAH__ -and_I [am but] dust and ash:
perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.
And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.
And he said, Oh let not <RF>The Masoretic Text has <i>'Adonai</i>, the original meaning of which was likely 'my_Lord'. It is spelled as 'my_lord' may be spelled.<Rf>my_Lord be angry, and I will speak: perhaps there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to <RF>Very many Hebrew manuscripts preserve the Name here, though the Masoretic Text largely replaces it with <i>'Adonai</i>.<Rf>YAH__: perhaps there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.
And he said, Oh let not <RF>The Masoretic Text has <i>'Adonai</i>, the original meaning of which was likely 'my_Lord'. It is spelled as 'my_lord' may be spelled.<Rf>my_Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: perhaps ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.
And YAH__ went his way, as soon as he_had_finished_(off) wording with 'Abraham: and 'Abraham returned to his place.<CM>
And the two messengers came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;
and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
And he urged them greatly; and they turned in toward him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened_breads, and they did eat.
But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
and they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may experience them.
And Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
And he said, I pray you, my brothers, do not so wickedly.
Behold now, I have two daughters that have not experienced man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing, <RF>Or, <i>for therefore</i><Rf>forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.
And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.
But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.<CM>
And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:
for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is become great before YAH__; and YAH__ hath sent us to destroy it.
And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law -(the ones) [becoming] takers_of his_daughters- and said, Up, get you out of this place; for YAH__ will destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons-in-law like_(one)_making_fun.
And when the morning arose, then the messengers hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy woman, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the <RF>Or, <i>punishment</i><Rf>iniquity of the city.
But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his woman, and upon the hand of his two daughters, YAH__ being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him outside the city.
And it_was, when they had brought them forth, abroad, that he said, Escape for thy <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'.

And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, <RF>The Masoretic Text has <i>'Adonai</i>, the original meaning of which was likely 'my_Lord'. It is spelled as 'my_lord' may be spelled.<Rf>my_lord:
behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy (loyal)_ardour, which thou hast shown to me in saving my <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'.

behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither -is it not a little one?- and my soul shall live.
And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.
Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called <RF>That is, <i>Little</i>. See this Genesis 19:20 and Genesis 14:8<Rf>Zeghor.<CM>
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came to Zeghor.
Then YAH__ rained upon Sodom and upon Ghomorrah brimstone and fire from YAH__ out of the skies;
and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
But his woman looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
And 'Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before YAH__:
and he looked toward Sodom and Ghomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.<CM>
And it_was, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered 'Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.<CM>
And Lot went up out of Zeghor, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zeghor: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
And the first-born_(daughter) said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come_(inside) to us after the manner of all the earth:
come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born_(daughter) went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
And it_was on the morrow, that the first-born_(daughter) said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also. And go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
And the first-born_(daughter) bare a son, and called his name Mo'ab: the same is the father_of Mo'ab to this day.
And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-`Ammee: the same is the father of the children of `Ammon to this day.<CM>
And 'Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.
And 'Abraham said of Sarrah his woman, She is my sister: and 'Abeemelekh king of Gerar sent, and took Sarrah.
But God came to 'Abeemelekh in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man's woman.
Now 'Abeemelekh had not come near her: and he said, <RF>Very many Hebrew manuscripts preserve the Name here, though the Masoretic Text largely replaces it with <i>'Adonai</i>.<Rf>YAH__, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?
Said he not himself to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.
And the_God said to him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me: on_(account of) this I_gave_thee not to touch her.
Now therefore restore the man's woman; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.<CM>
And 'Abeemelekh rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were very afraid.
Then 'Abeemelekh called 'Abraham, and said to him, What hast thou done to us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
And 'Abeemelekh said to 'Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
And 'Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my woman's sake.
And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my woman:
and it_was, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is thy_(loyal)_ardour which thou shalt show to me: at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
And 'Abeemelekh took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them to 'Abraham, and restored him Sarrah his woman.
And 'Abeemelekh said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
And to Sarrah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, <RF>Or, <i>he</i><Rf>it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and <RF>Or, <i>before all</i> men<Rf>in respect of all thou art righted.
And 'Abraham prayed to the_God: and God healed 'Abeemelekh, and his woman, and his maid-servants; and they bare children.
For YAH__ had firm closed up all the wombs of the house of 'Abeemelekh, because of Sarrah, 'Abraham's woman.<CM>
And YAH__ attended_to Sarrah as he had said, and YAH__ did for Sarrah as he had spoken.
And_(then) Sarrah conceived, and bare 'Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
And 'Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarrah bare to him, Yizahak.
And 'Abraham circumcised his son Yizahak when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
And 'Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Yizahak was born to him.
And Sarrah said, God hath <RF>Or, <i>prepared laughter for me</i><Rf>made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me.
And she said, Who would have said to 'Abraham, that Sarrah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.<CM>
And the child grew, and was weaned: and 'Abraham made a great feast on the day that Yizahak was weaned.
And Sarrah saw the son of Hagar the <RF>That is, 'Egyptian'.<Rf>Mezreet, whom she had borne to 'Abraham, (one)_<RF>Or, 'playing'<Rf>making_fun.
For_what_reason she said to 'Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son: for the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Yizahak.
And the thing was very grievous in 'Abraham's sight on account of his son.
And God said to 'Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid; in all that Sarrah saith to thee, hearken to her voice; for in Yizahak shall thy seed be called.
And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
And 'Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a <RF>Or, <i>skin</i><Rf>bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and <FI>gave her<Fi> the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Be'er-Shaba`.
And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
And she went, and sat her down opposite him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
And God heard the voice of the lad; and God's messenger called to Hagar out of the skies, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pa'ran: and his mother took him a woman out of the land of Mezrayim.<CM>
And it_was at that time, that 'Abeemelekh and Peekhol the captain of his host spoke to 'Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
now therefore swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with <RF>Or, <i>my offspring, nor with my posterity</i><Rf>my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the_(loyal)_ardour that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
And 'Abraham said, I will swear.
And 'Abraham reproved 'Abeemelekh because of the well of water, which 'Abeemelekh's servants had violently taken away.
And 'Abeemelekh said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today.
And 'Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to 'Abeemelekh; and they two made a covenant.
And 'Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
And 'Abeemelekh said to 'Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.
For_what_reason he called that place Be'er-Shaba`; because there they swore_(an oath) both of them.
So they made a covenant at Be'er-Shaba`: and 'Abeemelekh rose up, and Peekhol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Pulishteem.
And <FI>'Abraham<Fi> planted a tamarisk tree in Be'er-Shaba`, and called there on the name of YAH__, the Everlasting God.
And 'Abraham sojourned in the land of the Pulishteem many days.<CM>
And it_was after these things, that the_God did prove 'Abraham, and said to him, 'Abraham; and he said, Here am I.
And he said, Take now thy son, thy only son, whom thou lovest, even Yizahak, and get thee into the land of Moreeyah; and offer him there for an ascending-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
And 'Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Yizahak his son; and he clave the wood for the ascending-offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which the_God had told him.
On the third day 'Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
And 'Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.
And 'Abraham took the wood of the ascending-offering, and laid it upon Yizahak his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.
And Yizahak spoke to 'Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for an ascending-offering?
And 'Abraham said, God will <RF>Hebrew: <i>see for himself.</i><Rf>provide himself the lamb for an ascending-offering, my son: so they went both of them together.<CM>
And they came to the place which the_God had told him of; and 'Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Yizahak his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
And 'Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
And YAH__'s messenger called to him out of the skies, and said, 'Abraham, 'Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only son, from me.
And 'Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind [him] a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and 'Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for an ascending-offering in the stead of his son.
And 'Abraham called the name of that place <RF>That is, 'YAH__ shall_see', perhaps implying 'YAH__ shall_provide'.<Rf>YAH__-Yir'eh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of YAH__ <RF>Perhaps, as in the English phrase 'seen to' the implication is 'it_shall_be_(provided)'; or it may be read, 'he_shall_be_seen'.<Rf>it_shall_be_seen.
And YAH__'s messenger called to 'Abraham a second time out of the skies,
and said, By myself have I sworn, saith YAH__, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son,
that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the skies, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth <RF>Or, <i>bless themselves</i><Rf>be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
So 'Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Be'er-Shaba`; and 'Abraham dwelt at Be'er-Shaba`.<CM>
And it_was after these things, that it was told 'Abraham, saying, Behold, Melkah, she also hath borne children to thy brother Nakhor:
`Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kamu'el the father of 'Aram,
and Kased, and Hazau, and Paldash, and Yedlaph, and Bathu'el.
And Bathu'el begat Rebekah. These eight did Melkah bear to Nakhor, 'Abraham's brother.
And his concubine, whose name was Re'umah, she also bare Tabeh, and Gaham, and Tokhosh, and Ma`akhah.<CM>
And the life of Sarrah was (a) hundred years and_twenty years and_seven years: these were the years of the life of Sarrah.
And Sarrah died in Karyath-'Arbo` -the same is Khebron- in the land of Kana`an: and 'Abraham came to mourn for Sarrah, and to weep for her.
And 'Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Khet, saying,
I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: <RF>The Hebrew word can be used for giving or for selling, but clearly selling for a 'price' is here meant, see Genesis 23:8.<Rf>sell me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
And the children of Khet answered 'Abraham, saying to him,
Hear_us, <RF>Or "my_lord, prince_of God, [even] thou in_our_midst"<Rf>my_lord; thou [art] <RF>Or possibly "God's prince" or "(a) prince_of gods"<Rf>(a) prince_of God in_our_midst: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
And 'Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Khet.
And he communed with them, saying, If it be your <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'. Deeper than the external body which you see, his soul also has a hidden 'heart' of things which you cannot see with your eyes, like his thinking and awareness of himself and his experience of life. Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>soul that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to `Ephron the son of Zohor,
that he may <RF>The Hebrew word can be used for giving or for selling, but clearly selling for a 'price' is here meant.<Rf>sell to_me (the) cave_of the_Makhpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for the full price let him <RF>The Hebrew word can be used for giving or for selling, but clearly selling for a 'price' is here meant.<Rf>sell it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.
Now `Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Khet: and `Ephron the Khettee answered 'Abraham in the audience of the children of Khet, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Nay, my lord, hear me: the field <RF>The Hebrew word can be used for giving or for selling, but clearly selling for a 'price' is here meant. It is not that `Ephron is offering his field for nothing as English speakers may imagine from some translations, but that he is asking that not the cave alone but the field with the cave be bought.<Rf>sell I to_thee, and the cave that is therein, I <RF>The Hebrew word can be used for giving or for selling, but clearly selling for a 'price' is here meant.<Rf>sell it to_thee; in the presence of the children of my people <RF>The Hebrew word can be used for giving or for selling, but clearly selling for a 'price' is here meant.<Rf>sell I it to_thee: bury thy dead.
And 'Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
And he spoke to `Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will <RF>The Hebrew word can be used for giving or for selling, but clearly selling for a 'price' is here meant. 'Abraham is 'selling' the silver in exchange for the field.<Rf>give the price of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
And `Ephron answered 'Abraham, saying to him,
My lord, hearken to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekaleem of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead.
And 'Abraham hearkened to `Ephron; and 'Abraham weighed to `Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Khet, four hundred shekaleem of silver, current <FI>money<Fi> with the merchant.<CM>
So the field of `Ephron, which [was] in_the_Makhpelah, which was before Mamre', the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure
to 'Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Khet, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
And after this, 'Abraham buried Sarrah his woman in (the) cave_of (the) field_of the_Makhpelah before Mamre' -the same is Khebron- in the land of Kana`an.
And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure to 'Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Khet.<CM>
And 'Abraham was old, advancing in the days [of his life]: and YAH__ had blessed 'Abraham in all things.
And 'Abraham said to his servant, the older of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
and I will make thee swear by YAH__, the God of the skies and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a woman for my son of the daughters of the Kana`anee, among whom I dwell:
but thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a woman for my son Yizahak.
And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?
And 'Abraham said to him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
YAH__, the God of the skies, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore_(an oath) to me, saying, To thy seed will I give this land; he will send his messenger before thee, and thou shalt take a woman for my son from thence.
And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of 'Abraham his master, and swore_(an oath) to him concerning this matter.<CM>
And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, <RF>Or, <i>for all the goods of his master were in his hand</i><Rf>having all goodly things of his master's in his hand: and he arose, and went to <RF>That is, <i>'Aram_(of) two_rivers.</i>; understood to refer to Mesopotamia.<Rf>'Aram-Naharayim, to the city of Nakhor.
And he made the camels to kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, at_(the)_time_(of) (the) going_out_(of) the_(women)_drawing_water.
And he said, O YAH__, the God of my master 'Abraham, make_happen, I pray thee, before_me this day, and show kindness to my master 'Abraham.
Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water:
and let it become, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Yizahak; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master.
And it_was, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bathu'el the son of Melkah, the woman of Nakhor, 'Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
And the damsel was very good_of appearance, a virgin, neither had any man experienced her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.
And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
And the man looked steadfastly on her, being_silent, to_know whether YAH__ had made his journey prosperous or not.
And it_was, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring -<RF>That is, 'half a shekel'; see Exodus 38:26.<Rf>a_beka` its_weight- and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekaleem weight of gold,
and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bathu'el the son of Melkah, whom she bare to Nakhor.
She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
And the man bowed his head, and worshipped YAH__.
And he said, Blessed be YAH__, the God of my master 'Abraham, who hath not forsaken his (loyal)_ardour and his truth toward my master: as for me, YAH__ hath led me in the way to the house of my master's brothers.<CM>
And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.
And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the fountain.
And it_was, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.
And he said, Come in, thou blessed of YAH__; for_what_reason standest thou outside? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.
And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
And he said, I am 'Abraham's servant.
And YAH__ hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and donkeys.
And Sarrah my master's woman bare a son to my master when she was old: and to him hath he given all that he hath.
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a woman for my son of the daughters of the Kana`anee, in whose land I dwell:
but thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a woman for my son.
And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.
And he said to me, YAH__, before whom I walk, will send his messenger with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a woman for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
And I came this day to the fountain, and said, O YAH__, the God of my master 'Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:
behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and let it become, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink;
and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom YAH__ hath appointed for my master's son.
And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down to the fountain, and drew; and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bathu'el, Nakhor's son, whom Melkah bare to him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.
And I bowed my head, and worshipped YAH__, and blessed YAH__, the God of my master 'Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.<CM>
Then Laban answered -<RF>If not for the mention of Rebekah's father here, one would probably assume from the passage that her brother, Laban, had become the man of the house and the heir of Rebekah in the behalf of his departed father, Bathu'el, to consent to the marriage or refuse the marriage. In the receiving of gifts in Genesis 24:53, Bathu'el is not mentioned. In Genesis 24:60, they call Rebekah 'Our_sister' rather than 'Our_daughter'. Though all extent witnesses mention "Bathu'el_also" here, scholars have proposed that perhaps the original reading was either "his_mother_also" (see Genesis 24:55) or "his_house_also" (see Genesis 24:28) which each have some similarity in spelling, and could have become misread as "Bathu'el_also" by an early copyist.<Rf>Bathu'el_also- and_they_said, The thing proceedeth from YAH__: we cannot speak to thee bad or good.
Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's woman, as YAH__ hath spoken.
And it_was, that, when 'Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to YAH__.
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us <FI>a few<Fi> days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing YAH__ hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and 'Abraham's servant, and his men.
And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our_sister, be thou <FI>the mother<Fi> of thousands_of <RF>That is, ten_thousands<Rf>myriads, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.<CM>
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
And Yizahak came from the way of Be'er-Lahhay-Ro'ee; for he dwelt in the land of the South.
And Yizahak went out to meditate in the field [as it were] turning evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Yizahak, she alighted from the camel.
And she said to the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took <RF>It is a given that a women of this people would wear a veil. This is why it is called 'the_veil'. In Genesis 38:14 it is evidenced that the veil would sometimes be used to cover the face as far as obscuring the identity. Likewise here Rebekah uses 'the veil' to cover herself, adding to the feminine modesty that accompanied her in her journey.<Rf>the_veil, and covered herself.
And the servant told Yizahak all the things that he had done.
And Yizahak brought her into his mother Sarrah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his woman; and he loved her: and Yizahak was comforted after his mother's death.<CM>
And 'Abraham took another woman, and her name was Keturah.
And she bare him Zemran, and Yekshan, and Madan, and Madyan, and Yeshbok, and Shoh.
And Yekshan begat Shaba', and Dadan. And the sons of Dadan were 'Ashshureem, and Latusheem, and Lo'ommeem.
And the sons of Madyan: Ghaiphah, and `Opher, and Henokh, and 'Abeeda`, and 'Elda`ah. All these were the children of Keturah.
And 'Abraham gave all that he had to Yizahak.
But to the sons of the concubines, that 'Abraham had, 'Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Yizahak his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
And these are the days of the years of 'Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred seventy-five years.
And 'Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full <FI>of years<Fi>, and was gathered to his people.
And Yizahak and Yishma`'el his sons buried him in (the) cave_of the_Makhpelah, in the field of `Ephron the son of Zohor the Khettee, which is before Mamre';
the field which 'Abraham purchased of the children of Khet: there was 'Abraham buried, and Sarrah his woman.
And it_was after the death of 'Abraham, that God blessed Yizahak his son: and Yizahak dwelt by Be'er-Lahhay-Ro'ee.<CM>
Now these are the generations of Yishma`'el, 'Abraham's son, whom Hagar the <RF>That is, 'Egyptian'.<Rf>Mezreet, Sarrah's handmaid, bare to 'Abraham:
and these are the names of the sons of Yishma`'el, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Yishma`'el, Nabayoth; and Kedar, and 'Adbe'el, and Mabsam,
and Mashma`, and Dumah, and Massa',
Khoddad, and Taima', Yetur, Napheesh, and Kedmah:
these are the sons of Yishma`'el, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations.
And these are the years of the life of Yishma`'el, a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.
And they dwelt from Heweelah to Shur that is before Mezrayim, as thou goest toward 'Ashshur: he <RF>Or, <i>settled</i>  Hebrew: <i>fell.</i><Rf>abode opposite all his brothers.<CM>
And these are the generations of Yizahak, 'Abraham's son: 'Abraham begat Yizahak:
and Yizahak was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bathu'el the_'Arammee of Paddan-'Aram, the sister of Laban the_'Arammee, to be his woman.
And Yizahak entreated YAH__ for his woman, because she was barren: and YAH__ was entreated of him, and Rebekah his woman conceived.
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why [am] I [like] this? And she went to inquire of YAH__.
And YAH__ said to her,<CI><PI1>Two nations are in thy womb,<CI><PI1>And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels:<CI><PI1>And the one people shall be stronger than the other people;<CI><PI1>And the older shall serve the younger.<CM>
And when her days for_(giving)_birth were_fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
And the first came forth <RF>Or, <i>ruddy</i><Rf>red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name `Esau.
And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on `Esau's heel; and his name was called <RF>That is, <i>One that takes by the heel</i> or <i>supplants.</i><Rf>Ya`akob: and Yizahak was sixty years old when she bare them.<CM>
And the boys grew: and `Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and Ya`akob was a <RF>Or, <i>harmless. </i>Hebrew:<i> perfect.</i><Rf>quiet man, dwelling in tents.
And Yizahak loved `Esau, because he did eat of his wildmeat: and Rebekah loved Ya`akob.
And Ya`akob boiled pottage: and `Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:
and `Esau said to Ya`akob, Feed me, I pray thee, with <RF>Hebrew: <i>the red</i> pottage, <i>this red</i> pottage.<Rf>that same red <FI>pottage<Fi>; for I am faint: therefore was his name called <RF>That is, <i>Red.</i><Rf>'Edom.
And Ya`akob said, Sell me <RF>Hebrew: <i>today.</i><Rf>first thy birthright.
And `Esau said, Behold, I am about to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me?
And Ya`akob said, Swear to me <RF>Hebrew: <i>today.</i><Rf>first; and he swore_(an oath) to him: and he sold his birthright to Ya`akob.
And Ya`akob gave `Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so `Esau disesteemed his birthright.<CM>
And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of 'Abraham. And Yizahak went to 'Abeemelekh king of the Pulishteem, to Gerar.
And YAH__ appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Mezrayim; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for to thee, and to thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to 'Abraham thy father;
and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the skies, and will give to thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth <RF>Or, <i>bless themselves</i><Rf>be blessed;
because that 'Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commands, my statutes, and my laws.
And Yizahak dwelt in Gerar:
and the men of the place asked him of his woman; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, My woman; lest, <FI>said he<Fi>, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was good_of appearance.
And it_was, when he had been there a long time, that 'Abeemelekh king of the Pulishteem looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Yizahak [was] (one)_making_fun with Rebekah his_woman.
And 'Abeemelekh called Yizahak, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy woman: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Yizahak said to him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
And 'Abeemelekh said, What is this thou hast done to us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy woman, and thou wouldst have brought culpability upon us.
And 'Abeemelekh charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his woman shall surely be put to death.<CM>
And Yizahak sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold: and YAH__ blessed him.
And the man became great, and grew more and more until he became very great:
and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Pulishteem envied him.
Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of 'Abraham his father, the Pulishteem had stopped, and filled with earth.
And 'Abeemelekh said to Yizahak, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
And Yizahak departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.<CM>
And Yizahak dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of 'Abraham his father; for the Pulishteem had stopped them after the death of 'Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
And (the) servants_of Yizahak dug in the valley, and found there a well of <RF>Hebrew: <i>living.</i><Rf>springing water.
And (the) herdsmen_of Gerar strove with (the) herdsmen_of Yizahak, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well <RF>That is, 'Contention'<Rf>`Esek, because they contended with him.
And they dug another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it <RF>That is, <i>Enmity.</i><Rf>Sitnah.
And he removed from thence, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it <RF>That is, <i>Broad places</i>, or, <i>Room</i>.<Rf>Rohoboth; and he said, Because now YAH__ hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.<CM>
And he went up from thence to Be'er-Shaba`.
And YAH__ appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of 'Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant 'Abraham's sake.
And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of YAH__, and pitched his tent there: and there (the) servants_(of) Yizahak dug a well.<CM>
Then 'Abeemelekh went to him from Gerar, and 'Akhozzath his friend, and Peekhol the captain of his host.
And Yizahak said to them, For_what_reason are ye come to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
And they said, We saw plainly that YAH__ was with thee: and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,
that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of YAH__.
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
And_they_rose_up_early in_the_morning, and swore_(an oath) one to another: and Yizahak sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
And it_was the same day, that (the) servants_(of) Yizahak came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.
And he called it Shab`ah: therefore the name of the city is Be'er-Shaba` to this day.<CM>
And when `Esau was forty years old he took for (a)_woman Yhudeeth the daughter of Be'eree the Khettee, and Basemath the daughter of 'Ailon the Khettee:
and_they_became (a) bitterness_of spirit to_Yizahak and_to_Rebekah.<CM>
And it_was, that when Yizahak was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called `Esau his older son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Here am I.
And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me wildmeat;
and make me tasty_(delicacies of hunted meat), such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.<CM>
And Rebekah heard when Yizahak spoke to `Esau his son. And `Esau went to the field to hunt for wildmeat, and to bring it.
And Rebekah spoke to Ya`akob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to `Esau thy brother, saying,
Bring me wildmeat, and make me tasty_(delicacies of hunted meat), that I may eat, and bless thee before YAH__ before my death.
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good goatlings of the goats; and I will make them tasty_(delicacies [as] of hunted meat) for thy father, such as he loveth:
and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.
And Ya`akob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, `Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a <RF>Or, <i>mocker</i><Rf>deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
And his mother said to him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made tasty_(delicacies [as] of hunted meat), such as his father loved.
And Rebekah took the goodly garments of `Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Ya`akob her younger son;
and she put the skins of the goatlings of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
and she gave the tasty_(delicacies [as] of hunted meat) and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Ya`akob.<CM>
And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
And Ya`akob said to his father, I am `Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my wildmeat, that thy soul may bless me.
And Yizahak said to his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because YAH__ thy God made_[it]_happen before_me.
And Yizahak said to Ya`akob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son `Esau or not.
And Ya`akob went near to Yizahak his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Ya`akob's voice, but the hands are the hands of `Esau.
And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother `Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
And he said, Art thou my very son `Esau? And he said, I am.
And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's wildmeat, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
And his father Yizahak said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said,<CI><PI1>See, the smell of my son<CI><PI1>Is as the smell of a field which YAH__ hath blessed:<CI>
<PI1>And the_God give thee of the dew of the skies,<CI><PI1>And of the fatness of the earth,<CI><PI1>And plenty of grain and new wine:<CI>
<PI1>Let peoples serve thee,<CI><PI1>And nations bow down to thee:<CI><PI1>Be lord over thy brothers,<CI><PI1>And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:<CI><PI1>Cursed be every one that curseth thee,<CI><PI1>And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.<CM>
And it_was, as soon as Yizahak had made an end of blessing Ya`akob, and Ya`akob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Yizahak his father, that `Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
And he also made tasty_(delicacies of hunted meat), and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's wildmeat, that thy soul may bless me.
And Yizahak his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, `Esau.
And Yizahak trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken wildmeat, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, <FI>and<Fi> he shall be blessed.
When `Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.
And he said, Is not he rightly named Ya`akob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
And Yizahak responded and said to `Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with grain and new wine have I sustained him: and what then shall I do for thee, my son?
And `Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And `Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
And Yizahak his father responded and said to him,<CI><PI1>Behold, <RF>Or, <i>away from</i><Rf>of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling,<CI><PI1>And <RF>Or, <i>away from</i><Rf>of the dew of the skies from above.<CM>
And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother;<CI><PI1>And it shall become, when thou shalt break loose,<CI><PI1>That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.<CM>
And `Esau hated Ya`akob because of the blessing with_which his father blessed him: and `Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Ya`akob.
And the words of `Esau her older son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Ya`akob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother `Esau, concerning thee, doth comfort himself, <FI>purposing<Fi> to kill thee.
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Kharran;
and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;
until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?<CM>
And Rebekah said to Yizahak, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Khet: if Ya`akob take a woman of the daughters of Khet, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
And Yizahak called Ya`akob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Kana`an.
Arise, go to Paddan-'Aram, to the house of Bathu'el thy mother's father; and take thee a woman from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
And <RF>Hebrew: <i>'El Shaddai</i><Rf>God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples;
and give thee the blessing of 'Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave to 'Abraham.
And Yizahak sent away Ya`akob: and he went to Paddan-'Aram to Laban, son of Bathu'el the_'Arammee, the brother of Rebekah, Ya`akob's and `Esau's mother.<CM>
Now `Esau saw that Yizahak had blessed Ya`akob and sent him away to Paddan-'Aram, to take him a woman from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Kana`an;
and that Ya`akob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-'Aram:
and `Esau saw that the daughters of Kana`an pleased not Yizahak his father;
and `Esau went to Yishma`'el, and took, besides the women that he had, Maheleth the daughter of Yishma`'el 'Abraham's son, the sister of Nabayoth, to be his woman.<CM>
And Ya`akob went out from Be'er-Shaba`, and went toward Kharran.
And he lighted upon <RF>Hebrew: <i>the place.</i><Rf>a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
And he dreamed; and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to_the_skies; and behold, the messengers of God ascending and descending on it.
And, behold, YAH__ stood <RF>Or, <i>beside him</i><Rf>above it, and said, I am YAH__, the God of 'Abraham thy father, and the God of Yizahak: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt <RF>Hebrew: <i>break forth.</i><Rf>spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
And, behold, I am with thee, and_will_watch_(over)_thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
And Ya`akob awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely YAH__ is in this place; and I knew it not.
And he was afraid, and said, How fear_inspiring is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of the skies.<CM>
And Ya`akob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
And he called the name of that place <RF>That is, <i>The house of God</i><Rf>Baith-'El: but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
And Ya`akob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and_will_watch_(over)_me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,
so that I come again to my father's house in peace, <RF>Or, <i>then shall YAH__ be my God, and this stone...</i><Rf>and YAH__ will be my God,
then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth to thee.<CM>
Then Ya`akob lifted_up his feet, and came to the land of the children of the east.
And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the stone upon the well's mouth was great.
And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.
And Ya`akob said to them, My brothers, whence are ye? And they said, Of Kharran are we.
And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nakhor? And they said, We know him.
And he said to them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well: and, behold, Rakhel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
While he was yet speaking with them, Rakhel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.
And it_was, when Ya`akob saw Rakhel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Ya`akob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
And Ya`akob kissed Rakhel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
And Ya`akob told Rakhel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.<CM>
And it_was, when Laban heard the tidings of Ya`akob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
And Laban said to Ya`akob, Because thou art my brother, shouldst thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Le'ah, and the name of the younger was Rakhel.
And Le'ah's eyes were tender; but Rakhel was beautiful and well favored.
And Ya`akob loved Rakhel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rakhel thy younger daughter.
And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
And Ya`akob served seven years for Rakhel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her.<CM>
And Ya`akob said to Laban, Give me my woman, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go_(inside) to her.
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
And it_was in the evening, that he took Le'ah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went_(inside) to_her.
And Laban gave Zelpah his handmaid to his daughter Le'ah for a handmaid.
And it_was in the morning that, behold, it was Le'ah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? did not I serve with thee for Rakhel? for_what_reason then hast thou beguiled me?
And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born_(daughter).
Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
And Ya`akob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rakhel his daughter for (a)_woman.
And Laban gave to Rakhel his daughter Balhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.
And_he_went_(inside) also to_Rakhel, and he loved also Rakhel more than Le'ah, and served with him yet seven other years.<CM>
And YAH__ saw that Le'ah was hated, and he opened her womb: but Rakhel was barren.
And Le'ah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name <RF>That is, <i>See, a son.</i><Rf>R'uben: for she said, Because YAH__ hath looked upon my affliction: for now my husband will love me.
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because YAH__ <RF>Hebrew: <i>shama.</i><Rf>hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this <FI>son<Fi> also: and she called his name <RF>Hebrew: <i>Shim`on.</i><Rf>Shum`on.
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be <RF>From the root <i>LW-</i><Rf>joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Lewee.
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, This time will I <RF>From the Hebrew: <i>hodah.</i><Rf>praise YAH__: therefore she called his name <RF>The original pronunciation of Yhudah was probably Yuhuwda- from yuhuwdaya "He shall be praised", the subjunctive of an archaic pronunciation of the Hophal stem. Likewise, in Psalm 81:5 is a variant spelling of 'Yoseph', that is as would be expected for the original pronunciation of the name, which was probably Yuhawsipu, meaning "He shall add", from an archaic pronunciation of the Hiphil stem. Note that though both these names have YHW- in them, yet this is not from the theophoric element, YHW-, but from third-person, masculine, singular verbs of these causative stems. Conversely, the divine name, YHWH, itself is not based on a causative stem, but is a simple-stem verb having H and W from the archaic 'being' root, HWY.<Rf>Yhudah; and she left off bearing.<CM>
And when Rakhel saw that she bare Ya`akob no children, Rakhel envied her sister; and she said to Ya`akob, Give me children, or else I die.
And Ya`akob's anger was kindled against Rakhel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
And she said, Behold, my maid Balhah, go_(inside) to her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may <RF>Hebrew: <i>be built by her.</i><Rf>obtain children by her.
And she gave him Balhah her handmaid for (a)_woman: and Ya`akob went_(inside) to_her.
And Balhah conceived, and bare Ya`akob a son.
And Rakhel said, God hath <RF>Hebrew: <i>dan</i>, he judged.<Rf>judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
And Balhah Rakhel's handmaid conceived again, and bare Ya`akob a second son.
And Rakhel said, With <RF>Hebrew: <i>wrestlings of God.</i><Rf>mighty wrestlings have I <RF>Hebrew: <i>niphtal</i>, he wrestled.<Rf>wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Nephtalee.<CM>
When Le'ah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zelpah her handmaid, and gave her to Ya`akob for (a)_woman.
And Zelpah Le'ah's handmaid bare Ya`akob a son.
And Le'ah said, <RF>Hebrew: <i>With fortune!</i>. Another reading is, <i>Fortune is come.</i><Rf>Fortunate! and she called his name <RF>That is, <i>Fortune.</i><Rf>Gad.
And Zelpah Le'ah's handmaid bare Ya`akob a second son.
And Le'ah said, <RF>Hebrew: <i>With my happiness!</i><Rf>Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name <RF>That is, <i>Happy.</i><Rf>'Asher.<CM>
And R'uben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found <RF>Or, <i>love apples</i><Rf>mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Le'ah. Then Rakhel said to Le'ah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldst thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rakhel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee tonight for thy son's mandrakes.
And Ya`akob came from the field in the evening, and Le'ah went out to meet him, and said, To_me thou_shalt_come_(inside); for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
And God hearkened to Le'ah, and she conceived, and bare Ya`akob a fifth son.
And Le'ah said, God hath given me my <RF>Hebrew: <i>sakhar.</i><Rf>hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Yishsakhar.
And Le'ah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Ya`akob.
And Le'ah said, God hath endowed me with a good gift; now will my husband <RF>Hebrew: <i>zabal</i>, he dwelt.<Rf>dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zabulon.
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Deenah.
And God remembered Rakhel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
and she called his name Yoseph, saying, <RF>Or "YAH__ is_adding..." or "YAH__ [is] (one)_adding..."<Rf>(May) YAH__ <RF>Hebrew: <i>yoseph</i><Rf>add to me another son.<CM>
And it_was, when Rakhel had borne Yoseph, that Ya`akob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
Give me my women and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service with_which I have served thee.
And Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in thy eyes, <FI>tarry<Fi>: <FI>for<Fi> I have divined that YAH__ hath blessed me for thy sake.
And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.
For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath <RF>Hebrew: <i>broken forth.</i><Rf>increased to a multitude; and YAH__ hath blessed thee <RF>Hebrew: <i>at my foot.</i><Rf>whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?
And he said, What shall I give thee? And Ya`akob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.
I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and <FI>of such<Fi> shall be my hire.
So shall my righteousness answer for me in tomorrow's day, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that <FI>if found<Fi> with me, shall be counted stolen.
And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
But he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;
and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Ya`akob: and Ya`akob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.<CM>
And Ya`akob took him rods of fresh <RF>Or, 'storax-tree'<Rf>poplar, and_[of]_almond-tree and_[of]_plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
And he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.
And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.
And Ya`akob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not to Laban's flock.
And it_was, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Ya`akob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Ya`akob's.
And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and donkeys.<CM>
And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Ya`akob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this <RF>Or, <i>wealth</i><Rf>glory.
And Ya`akob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as previously.
And YAH__ said to Ya`akob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
And Ya`akob sent and called Rakhel and Le'ah to the field to his flock,
and said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as previously; but the God of my father hath been with me.
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God gave_him not to_cause_evil with_me.
If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
And it_was at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
And (the) messenger_of the_God said to me in the dream, Ya`akob: and I said, Here am I.
And he said, Lift up now thy eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee.
I am the God of Baith-'El, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow to me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return to the land of thy nativity.
And Rakhel and Le'ah responded and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured <RF>Or, <i>the price paid for us</i><Rf>our money.
For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said to thee, do.<CM>
Then Ya`akob rose up, and set his sons and his women upon the camels;
and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-'Aram, to go to Yizahak his father to the land of Kana`an.
Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rakhel stole the terapheem that were her father's.
And Ya`akob <RF>Hebrew: <i>stole the heart of Laban the_'Arammee.</i><Rf>stole away unawares to Laban the_'Arammee, in that he told him not that he fled.
So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over <RF>That is, the Puratt, the Euphrates.<Rf>the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gal`ad.<CM>
And it was told Laban on the third day that Ya`akob was fled.
And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gal`ad.
And God came to Laban the_'Arammee in a dream of the night, and said to him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Ya`akob either good or bad.
And Laban caught_up_[to] Ya`akob. Now Ya`akob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brothers encamped in the mountain of Gal`ad.
And Laban said to Ya`akob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?
For_what_reason didst thou flee secretly, and <RF>Hebrew: <i>didst steal me.</i><Rf>steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;
and didst not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Ya`akob either good or bad.
And now, goingly thou_hast_gone because yearningly thou_hast_yearned for_(the)_house_of thy_father. For_what_reason hast thou stolen my gods?
And Ya`akob responded and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldst take thy daughters from me by force.
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brothers discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Ya`akob knew not that Rakhel had stolen them.<CM>
And Laban went into Ya`akob's tent, and into Le'ah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Le'ah's tent, and entered into Rakhel's tent.
Now Rakhel had taken the terapheem, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the terapheem.<CM>
And Ya`akob was wroth, and contended against Laban: and Ya`akob responded and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?
Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and thy brothers, that they judge betwixt us two.
These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
(A thing)_torn_(by a beast) I_brought not to thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.
These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Except the God of my father, the God of 'Abraham, and the Fear of Yizahak, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.<CM>
And Laban responded and said to Ya`akob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
And Ya`akob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
And Ya`akob said to his brothers, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
And Laban called it <RF>That is, '(The) heap_of the_witness', in Aramaic.<Rf>Yegar-Sahadutha: but Ya`akob called it <RF>That is, 'Heap_of witness', in Hebrew.<Rf>Gal`ed.
And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Gal`ed:
and <RF>That is, <i>The watch tower.</i><Rf>Massephah, for he said, YAH__ watch between me and thee, when we are <RF>Hebrew: <i>hidden.</i><Rf>absent one from another.
If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take women besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
And Laban said to Ya`akob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.
This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
The God of 'Abraham, and the God of Nakhor -<RF>The Greek Septuagint and a couple of Hebrew manuscripts lacks '(the) God_of their_father'.<Rf>(the) <RF>Or, 'gods'<Rf>God_of their_father- <RF>Thus reads the Masoretic Text, but the Samaritan, the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate have 'he_shall_judge'.<Rf>they_shall_judge betwixt_us. And Ya`akob swore_(an oath) by the Fear of his father Yizahak.
And Ya`akob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain. <RF>[Chapter 32:1 in Hebrew]<Rf>
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned to his place.<CM>
And Ya`akob went on his way, and the messengers of God met him.
And Ya`akob said when he saw them, This is God's camp: and he called the name of that place <RF>That is, <i>Two hosts</i>, or, <i>Companies</i>.<Rf>Mahanayim.<CM>
And Ya`akob sent messengers before him to `Esau his brother to the land of Se`eer, the field of 'Edom.
And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord `Esau: Thus saith thy servant Ya`akob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:
and I have oxen, and donkeys, <FI>and<Fi> flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.
And the messengers returned to Ya`akob, saying, We came to thy brother `Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Then Ya`akob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
and he said, If `Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
And Ya`akob said, O God of my father 'Abraham, and God of my father Yizahak, O YAH__, who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:
<RF>Hebrew: <i>I am less than all...</i><Rf>I am not worthy of the least of all the (loyal)_ardours, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Yordan; and now I am become two companies.
Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of `Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<CM>
And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for `Esau his brother:
two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
And he commanded the foremost, saying, When `Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
then thou shalt say, [They are] thy servant Ya`akob's; it is a present sent to my lord `Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.
And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak to `Esau, when ye find him;
and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Ya`akob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.
So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.<CM>
And he rose up that night, and took his two women, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Yabok.
And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
And Ya`akob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Ya`akob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Ya`akob.
And he said, Thy name shall not be called Ya`akob anymore, but <RF>That is, <i>He who striveth with God</i>, or, <i>God striveth.</i><Rf>Yisra'el: for thou hast <RF>Or, <i>had power with</i><Rf>striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
And Ya`akob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, For_what_reason is it that thou_art_asking for_my_name? And he blessed him there.
And Ya`akob called the name of the place <RF>That is, <i>The face of God.</i><Rf>Panee'el: for, <FI>said he<Fi>, I have seen God face to face, and my <RF>A living person -like the animals and the things with which the waters teem- is 'a living soul', a bodily 'soul'. When you see his external body you see his 'soul', but your eyes can only see the outer part of his 'soul'. Deeper than the external body which you see, his soul also has a hidden 'heart' of things which you cannot see with your eyes, like his thinking and awareness of himself and his experience of life. Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>soul is preserved.
And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Panu'el, and he limped upon his thigh.
Therefore the children of Yisra'el eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Ya`akob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.<CM>
And Ya`akob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, `Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Le'ah, and to Rakhel, and to the two handmaids.
And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Le'ah and her children after, and Rakhel and Yoseph hindermost.
And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
And `Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.
Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
And Le'ah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Yoseph near and Rakhel, and they bowed themselves.
And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
And `Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.
And Ya`akob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; <RF>Or, <i>for therefore have I seen</i><Rf>forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Take, I pray thee, my <RF>Hebrew: <i>blessing</i>.<Rf>gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have <RF>Hebrew: <i>all.</i><Rf>enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and_the_flocks and_the_herds -nursing_(ones) [are] upon_me- and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Se`eer.
And `Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
So `Esau returned that day on his way to Se`eer.
And Ya`akob journeyed to Sokkoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called <RF>That is, <i>Booths.</i><Rf>Sokkoth.<CM>
And Ya`akob came <RF>Or, <i>to Shalem, a city</i><Rf>in peace to the city of Shukhem, which is in the land of Kana`an, when he came from Paddan-'Aram; and encamped before the city.
And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hemor, Shukhem's father, for a hundred qesitah [of money].
And he erected there an altar, and called it <RF>That is, <i>God, the God of Yisra'el.</i><Rf>'El-'Elohe-Yisra'el.<CM>
And Deenah the daughter of Le'ah, whom she bare to Ya`akob, <RF>If Deenah had remained with her own people, or had taken even one of her brothers with her, would any of this tragedy result? Learn from Deenah's story. The world's people are corrupt -disobedient to God's ways- and one cannot make the world safe. One can easily keep oneself and one's daughters safe, by what one does: by walking wisely.<Rf>went out to see the daughters of the land.
And Shukhem the son of Hemor the Hewwee, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
And his soul clave to Deenah the daughter of Ya`akob, and he loved the damsel, and_he_worded upon (the) <RF>Deeper than the external body which you see, a living man's 'soul' also has a hidden 'heart' of things which you cannot see with your eyes, like his thinking and awareness of himself and his experience of life. Besides these things hidden from you in the 'heart' of his 'soul' -things that he is generally aware of- there are some things so deep in the 'heart' of his 'soul' that they may hide even from him, in his 'spirit': motivations, influences from God's Spirit and/or other spirits, and the 'breath of life' that God gave him to sustain him.<Rf>heart (of) the_damsel.
And Shukhem spoke to his father Hemor, saying, Get me this damsel for (a)_woman.
Now Ya`akob heard that he had defiled Deenah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Ya`akob was_silent until they came.
And Hemor the father of Shukhem went out to Ya`akob to commune with him.
And the sons of Ya`akob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Yisra'el in lying with Ya`akob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
And Hemor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shukhem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her to him for (a)_woman.
And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
And Shukhem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me I will give.
Ask me ever so much brideprice and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me: but give me the damsel for (a)_woman.
And the sons of Ya`akob answered Shukhem and Hemor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Deenah their sister,
and said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach to us.
Only on this condition will we consent to you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;
then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.<CM>
And their words pleased Hemor, and Shukhem Hemor's son.
And the young man deferred not to_effectuate the_thing, because he had delight in Ya`akob's daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.
